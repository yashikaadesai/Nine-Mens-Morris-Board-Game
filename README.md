INTRODUCTION:


Nine Men's Morris, also known as Mill, is a strategic board game dating back to ancient times, 
with origins tracing to the Roman Empire. Players strategically position and move their pieces to form 'mills',
allowing them to remove their opponent's pieces. This classic game challenges players to anticipate moves, 
create strategic alignments, and outwit their opponents.

GAME RULES:

-The goal is to form "mills," which are three of your pieces lined up horizontally or vertically. Once a mill is formed, you can remove one of your 
opponent's pieces from the board.

-Each player starts with nine pieces of a distinct color. Players take turns placing their pieces on empty intersections on the board.

-After all pieces are placed, players alternate moving one piece along a line to an adjacent intersection. This is to form or break mills.

-If a player forms a mill during the movement phase, they can remove one opponent's piece of their choice from the board, except if the 
opponent's pieces are in a mill.

-Once a player is reduced to three pieces, they can "fly," meaning they can move to any empty spot on the board, not just adjacent ones.

-A player wins by reducing their opponent to fewer than three pieces, or by blocking the opponent's moves such that they cannot make any valid moves.

-If neither player can make a legal move, the game ends in a draw.
